# Project Overview: AI OnCall Bot

## 🎯 Project Vision

The AI OnCall Bot is an intelligent, multi-channel assistant that processes user messages from various communication platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, Email) through OpenAI and phi data lib to understand, classify, and respond to requests based on predefined YAML workflows. The bot serves as an automated first line of support, routing requests appropriately and providing intelligent responses, regardless of the originating channel.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-Channel Support**: Works with Slack, Teams, Discord, Email, and more via a pluggable adapter system
- **Intelligent Message Processing**: Uses OpenAI models to understand user intent and context
- **Request Classification**: Automatically categorizes requests (support, information, action, etc.)
- **Workflow Automation**: Executes predefined YAML workflows based on request types
- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Maintains context across conversation threads
- **Smart Routing**: Directs requests to appropriate handlers or escalates to humans

### Integration Points
- **Channel Adapters**: Modular adapters for each supported platform (Slack, Teams, etc.)
- **OpenAI Proxy**: Configurable AI model integration for natural language processing
- **phi data lib**: Advanced workflow orchestration and agent management
- **YAML Workflows**: Flexible, configurable business logic definitions

## 🎭 User Personas

### Primary Users
1. **Employees**: Request support, information, or actions through their preferred channel
2. **Support Teams**: Receive escalated requests with AI-generated context
3. **Administrators**: Configure workflows and monitor bot performance

### Use Cases
- **Technical Support**: "My application is not responding" (from any channel)
- **Information Requests**: "How do I access the VPN?"
- **Action Requests**: "Please create a new user account for John"
- **Emergency Escalation**: "Production server is down - critical issue"

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds for initial acknowledgment
- **Classification Accuracy**: > 85% correct intent detection
- **Resolution Rate**: > 70% of requests handled without human intervention
- **User Satisfaction**: > 4.0/5.0 user rating

### Development Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: > 90% code coverage
- **Deployment Time**: < 5 minutes for updates
- **Bug Rate**: < 1 critical bug per 1000 requests
- **Development Velocity**: Consistent sprint completion

## 🎬 User Journey Examples

### Support Request Flow (Any Channel)
1. User: "My service is down, getting 500 errors"
2. Bot: Classifies as "critical support request"
3. Bot: Executes support workflow from YAML
4. Bot: Gathers additional context through follow-up questions
5. Bot: Creates ticket and escalates to on-call engineer
6. Bot: Provides user with ticket number and expected response time

### Information Request Flow
1. User: "How do I reset my password?"
2. Bot: Classifies as "information request"
3. Bot: Executes info workflow from YAML
4. Bot: Provides step-by-step instructions with links
5. Bot: Asks if user needs additional help
6. Bot: Marks request as resolved or escalates if needed

## 📋 Requirements Overview
